Image analysis: homography: planar homography.
Implementation independent of OpenCV, calculates it directly. Using C# .NET and using MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra;
If images of different sizes are ment to be used, change Coordinate transformations and also the real world sizes. This is an image of chess board, where real world cell size is measured in cm, it is set in the code for the real world size 7 cm * 9.3cm.

We are using calculated H matrix for line following robot, to calculate correct track segment lengths.
